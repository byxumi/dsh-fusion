// DSH-Folk host-capability prompt plugin (cordis / dsh plugin, single zero-dependency ESM file).
//
// Purpose: tell the agent inside the container that it runs on an Android host, which extra
// commands that host provides (dsh-fs / dsh-native), and which capabilities are actually on
// right now.
//
// Why systemPrompt.section instead of AGENTS.md:
//   - A section registered in the global layer is visible to every agent preset, while the web
//     profile disables the global agent-instructions row and mounts it per preset instead — so
//     an AGENTS.md rule silently disappears when the user switches preset.
//   - It lands in the system-prompt prefix: stable KV cache, no conversation-history cost, and
//     nothing to re-inject after compaction.
//   - `text` may be a provider function, so flipping a switch changes the very next assemble
//     without restarting dsh.
//
// Why this text is English while the app UI is localized: every section dsh itself registers
// (harness:identity, tool:read, tool:bash …) is English. A mixed-script system prompt nudges
// the model's output language, which is not ours to decide — the user's language is passed as
// a FACT below (`locale`) so the model can honour it deliberately.
//
// Facts come from /root/.dsh/host-facts.json, written by the app (DshHostPrompt.kt).
// Reading a file rather than querying the bridge: a section text provider is synchronous, so
// no HTTP can happen here.
